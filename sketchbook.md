GROUP 2:

A random plane crash from Denver to the Caribbean left Paris Eck, Shivam Pathak, Semir Poljakovic, Destiny Robertson, Nicolas Schlaepfer, Caleb Seiwald, Dustin Story, and Jessie Medina trapped on a deserted island being the only survivors. Finding a solution that would guarantee everyone's survival became our main priority.

During our first two days of exploration of the island, we came across an old hut with first aid supplies, which proved to be a useful tool for treating wounds and diseases. We also discovered a collection of ancient food rations from the Vietnam War, dating back to the 1960s and providing a preserved food source. Along with the island's many coconuts, fruits, and fresh water sources, we made the most of these resources to suit our urgent survival needs.

Following that, over the course of the following two days, we started to understand the value of cooperation and defined clear roles and duties based on our unique skill sets. We collaborated effectively, exchanging information and offering one another support as we used our combined skills to come up with innovative solutions and ensure our survival.

We were able to discuss issues, make choices, and continue open communication during the following week's sessions. We handled disagreements in a constructive manner, generating the kind of climate that was necessary for our survival.

We built tools, weapons, and shelters out of the available branches, vines, and boulders at these sessions as we started to acclimate to our environment. We were able to make the most of the island's natural resources and improve our chances of surviving until help arrived thanks to our resourcefulness.

After a month, a passing ship saw our distress signals, leading to our rescue. Each participant cast a vote for the best option, understanding that it was only by our combined efforts, unity, and efficient use of the resources at our disposal that we were able to survive.
