GROUP 2:

A random plane crash from Denver to the Caribbean left Paris Eck, Shivam Pathak, Semir Poljakovic, Destiny Robertson, Nicolas Schlaepfer, Caleb Seiwald, Dustin Story, and Jessie Medina trapped on a deserted island being the only survivors. Finding a solution that would guarantee everyone's survival became our main priority.

During our first two days of exploration of the island, we came across an old hut with first aid supplies, which proved to be a useful tool for treating wounds and diseases. We also discovered a collection of ancient food rations from the Vietnam War, dating back to the 1960s and providing a preserved food source. Along with the island's many coconuts, fruits, and fresh water sources, we made the most of these resources to suit our urgent survival needs.

Following that, over the course of the following two days, we started to understand the value of cooperation and defined clear roles and duties based on our unique skill sets. We collaborated effectively, exchanging information and offering one another support as we used our combined skills to come up with innovative solutions and ensure our survival.

We were able to discuss issues, make choices, and continue open communication during the following week's sessions. We handled disagreements in a constructive manner, generating the kind of climate that was necessary for our survival.

We built tools, weapons, and shelters out of the available branches, vines, and boulders at these sessions as we started to acclimate to our environment. We were able to make the most of the island's natural resources and improve our chances of surviving until help arrived thanks to our resourcefulness.

After a month, a passing ship saw our distress signals, leading to our rescue. Each participant cast a vote for the best option, understanding that it was only by our combined efforts, unity, and efficient use of the resources at our disposal that we were able to survive.

Mind mapping is a visual form of note taking that offers an overview of a topic and its complex information, allowing students to comprehend, create new ideas and build connections. Through the use of colors, images and words, mind mapping encourages students to begin with a central idea and expand outward to more in-depth sub-topics. ([linkLinks to an external site.](http://www.inspiration.com/visual-learning/mind-mapping))

**Mind mapping can be helpful when organizing ideas ...**

- Writing papers

## Week 4: [What is Creativity?]
### July 3, 2023
<details>
<summary>Main Ideas</summary>

- Idea 1: Creativity is Contagious
- Idea 2: Connections
- ...

</details>

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>

- **Key Terms:** Inovation, Evolution, Serendipitous, physical space
- **Class Notes:** Your class notes here.
- **Reading Notes:** Lesson 7: Serendipitous discoveries can be facilitated by a shared intellectual or physical space.
When ideas converge in a shared physical or intellectual space, through for example people from different disciplines meeting, creative collisions happen. Consider the modernist cultural innovations of the 1920s. Many of them were largely a result of artists, poets and writers meeting at the same Parisian cafés. Shared interactions allow ideas to diffuse, circulate and be combined randomly with others.

On an individual level, facilitating such serendipitous connections is simply a matter of simultaneously introducing ideas from different disciplines into your consciousness. Innovators like Benjamin Franklin and Charles Darwin favored working on multiple projects simultaneously, in a kind of slow multitasking mode. One project would take center stage for days at a time, but linger at the back of the mind afterwards too, so connections between projects could be drawn.

The philosopher John Locke understood the importance of cross-referencing as early on as 1652, when he began developing an elaborate system for indexing the content of his commonplace book, essentially a scrapbook of interesting thoughts and findings. Such books formed his repository of ideas and hunches, maturing and waiting to be connected to new ideas.

On an organizational level, the key to innovation and inspiration is a network which allows hunches to mature, scatter and combine with others openly.

The greatest such network in existence is, of course, the World Wide Web, where a wealth of ideas is not only available, but hyper-linked for easy connections between several disciplines.

This week I want my sketchbook to showcase different 3D physical space we experience as humans and there are only two of them. Natural and Engineered. I think these are the only spaces we can experience right not.

1. Lateral Thinking and Vertical Thinking are distinct methods of problem-solving and idea generation. Lateral Thinking involves a nontraditional, 'outside-the-box' approach, while Vertical Thinking follows a more conventional, linear process. Both play crucial roles in idea generation and problem-solving, but their utilization can greatly depend on the nature of the problem and the desired solution that is currently at hand.
    
2. Creativity and Innovation through Collaboration: Innovation often comes from the of diverse ideas and perspectives. Collaboration provides a platform for these diverse ideas to interact and amalgamate. The synergistic effect of collaboration often results in creative solutions that would not have been possible by individuals working in isolation. Additionally, adopting new methods like observation and unfamiliar ways of thinking can further foster creativity. Observation can help identify patterns or details that others may overlook, leading to unique insights. Embracing unfamiliar ways of thinking can break habitual thought patterns and open new pathways for innovative solutions.
    
3. Given the inability to access the specific readings and videos, I'll provide general examples of how new ways of thinking can be applied:
    
    Disadvantages of the System: An example could be challenging existing systems and practices in an organization. This might involve questioning the efficiency of current processes or the efficacy of traditional methodologies, thus creating room for innovation and improvement. (Old Ideas sometimes die)
        
    Creativity is Contagious: This could relate to the idea that exposure to creative individuals or environments can stimulate our own creativity. For instance, a workplace that encourages free expression of ideas and fosters a culture of innovation can influence its members to think creatively. (I think of Apple)
        
    The Art of Noticing: This might be about the value of observation in fostering creativity. For instance, a designer might draw inspiration from patterns in nature, or a marketer might develop a new campaign based on subtle shifts in consumer behavior.
        
4. Imagined Scenario: In a research institute, I imagen a "Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration Day." On this day, researchers from different fields would come together to share their work and brainstorm solutions for real world complex, real-world problems. For instance, an environmental scientist, a computer scientist, and a sociologist might collaborate to develop a comprehensive model for predicting and mitigating the impacts of climate change on human societies.

<summary>Main Ideas</summary>

<summary>Notes</summary>

- **Key Terms:** Definitions here.
- **Class Notes:** The philosopher John Locke understood the importance of cross-referencing as early on as 1652, when he began developing an elaborate system for indexing the content of his commonplace book, essentially a scrapbook of interesting thoughts and findings. Such books formed his repository of ideas and hunches, maturing and waiting to be connected to new ideas.
- **Reading Notes:** A cliche is a stereotyped phrase, a stereotyped way of looking at something or describing something. But cliches refer not only to arrangements of ideas but to ideas themselves. It is usually assumed that basic ideas are sound and then one starts fitting them together to give different patterns. But the basic ideas are themselves patterns that can be reconstructed. It is the purpose of lateral thinking to challenge any assumption for it is the purpose of lateral thinking to try and restructure any pattern. General agreement about an assumption is no guarantee that it is correct. It is historical continuity that maintains most assumptions - not a repeated assent of their validity. & The most basic principle of lateral thinking is that any particular way of looking at things is only one from among many other possible ways. Lateral thinking is concerned with exploring these other ways by restructuring and rearranging the information that is available. The very word ‘lateral’ suggests the movement sideways to generate alternative patterns instead of moving straight ahead with the development of one particular pattern. This is indicated in the diagrams opposite.

Here is my assingment this week: 
   Collecting Data
Collecting Data
An individual I find it challenging to understand from my perspective is someone who holds starkly contrasting political views. For instance, someone
who supports a political party or leader that I strongly disagree with, like Donald Trump.
To gain insight, I could seek their assistance on political matters, such as guidance on voting in an upcoming election, involvement in a social
movement, or resolving conflicts with friends or family members who hold opposing views. I could also seek advice on navigating political aspects of
business.
As long as their suggestions are not harmful, illegal, or unethical, I would be open to following their guidance. This may involve listening to their
arguments, exploring their sources, consuming their media, attending their events, or implementing their advice. Throughout this process, I would
strive to maintain an open-minded and respectful attitude, even if I ultimately do not agree with them.
To document my experience, I would write a reflection or create a video that outlines the lessons I learned from the interaction. This documentation
would include the following points:
The specific problem I sought help with and the reasons behind my choice.
Details about the person I approached for assistance and the method I used to connect with them.
The solution they proposed and how they explained it to me.
The actions I took to implement their solution and the outcomes I observed.
My emotional state during and after the interaction, including any feelings of anger, frustration, curiosity, empathy, or surprise.
The insights I gained from the interaction, such as any shifts in perspective or understanding of the issue or the person. Additionally, any
challenges to my assumptions or beliefs and any inspiration to take action or make changes.
-The overall impact of the experience on my own personal growth and development.
Any future steps or actions I plan to take based on what I learned from this interaction.
A final reflection on the importance of engaging with individuals who hold opposing views, even if it may be challenging or uncomfortable.
By documenting my experience in this way, I can not only gain a deeper understanding of someone like Donald Trump and their supporters, but also
share my insights with others who may be interested in bridging political divides and fostering respectful dialogue

- **Key Terms:** Definitions here.
- **Class Notes:** The researchers aren’t sure how to explain their results; they suggest a “spontaneous tagging process” takes place when an idea is generated unconsciously, alerting us to its level of creativity. While admitting this theory is speculative, they note that — whatever its cause — this sort of discernment is “vitally important for everyday creativity.”

## Conclusion
_Final thoughts and reflections on the course._
This has been  a really fun cousres. I forced my self to think outside the box. I enjoy reading and watching videos on creativity. I orginally was taking courses at UCCS as a bachelor of Innovation student. I really enjoyed those classes and love that I am ending my computer science degeree at CU denver taking a class on creativity. It has come to my thought that eveyone has the ability to be creative and create things in a innovative way. I believe learning the tools help alot.
